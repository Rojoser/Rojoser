# Hello thereâœ¨! 

My name is Agustin Rojo and this is my public repository where you can find some of the projects I have worked on.

## About me

I am a Mechanical Engineer and Data Scienctist.

Over 10 years of my career I developed automotive components and robotic systems. I then got bit by the data bug and have been involved in Data Analytics and Data Science not looking back.
